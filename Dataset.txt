For the important case in which the data are hypothesized to follow the normal distribution, depending on the nature of the test statistic and thus the underlying hypothesis of the test statistic, different null hypothesis tests have been developed.


This is to be expected, as the experiments are different experiments, and the sample spaces and the probability distributions for the outcomes are different even though the observed data (50 heads out of 100 flips) are the same for the two experiments.

He called on researchers to combine "p" in the mind with other types of evidence for and against that hypothesis, such as the a priori plausibility of the hypothesis and the relative strengths of results from previous studies.

If the null hypothesis were instead that the coin came up heads 99% of the time (otherwise the same setup), the "p"-value would instead be formula_30 In this case the null hypothesis could not definitely be ruled out – this outcome is unlikely in the null hypothesis, but not impossible – but the null hypothesis would be rejected at the 0.05 level, and in fact at the 0.02 level, since the outcome is less than 2% likely in the null hypothesis.

As such, the only hypothesis that needs to be specified in this test and embodies the counter-claim is referred to as the null hypothesis.

The incompatibility of the "p"-value with the likelihood principle indicates a lack of conceptual integrity in this methodology as the intentions of the analyst to analyze the data along differing prescriptions (experimental designs, choice of statistic) yield different results for the same data concerning the same underlying question about the coins fairness.

For example, "p"-values do not directly address the probability of the null hypothesis being true or false, and the choice of significance threshold should not be arbitrary but instead informed by the consequences of a false positive.

As a general example, if a null hypothesis is assumed to follow a standard normal distribution N(0,1), then the rejection of this null hypothesis can either mean (i) the mean is not zero, or (ii) the variance is not unity, or (iii) the distribution is not normal, depending on the type of test performed.

If formula_10 is the observed value, then very often, the "as extreme or more extreme than what was actually observed" means formula_18 (right-tail event), but one often also looks at outcomes which are extreme in the other direction, or which are extreme in either direction.

The cometary theory, on the other hand, popular among earth scientists of the 1930s and 40's, is that bays are the result of an encounter between North America and a low density comet exploding above or impacting with the Laurentide Ice Sheet ~12,900 years ago Supporting evidence includes the failure of "wind and wave" theories to satisfactorily account for a number of the peculiar features of Carolina Bays, including the recent identification of markers suggestive of an extraterrestrial connection, the alignment of bays with points over the Great Lakes, and their tendency to overlap one another from east to west.

However, he did not use the term the way we do, by bloodlines, but rather, introduced new dynasties whenever he detected some sort of discontinuity whether geographical (Dynasty IV from Memphis, Dynasty V from Elephantine), or genealogical (especially in Dynasty I, he refers to each successive Pharaoh as the "son" of the previous to define what he means by "continuity").

In fact, the earliest surviving trigonometric table, the 4th–5th century Siddhantas from India, was a table of values for the sine and versed sine only (in 3.75-degree increments from 0 to 90 degrees).

The versed sine, also called the versine and, in Latin, the "sinus versus" ("flipped sine") or the "sagitta" ("arrow"), is a trigonometric function versin(θ) (sometimes abbreviated "vers") defined by the equation:

There are also the two corresponding functions: the coversed sine (the versed sine of the "co"mplementary angle &pi/2 − θ), and the haversed sine ("ha"lf the versed sine).

As θ goes to zero, versin(θ) is the difference between two nearly equal quantities, so a user of a trigonometric table for cosine only would need a very high accuracy to obtain the versine, making separate tables for the latter convenient.

As θ goes to zero, versin(θ) is the difference between two nearly equal quantities, so a user of a trigonometric table for the cosine alone would need a very high accuracy to obtain the versine, making separate tables for the latter convenient.


Another historical advantage of the versine is that it is always non-negative, so its logarithm is defined except for the single angle (θ=0) where it is zero—thus, one could use logarithmic tables for multiplications in formulas involving versines.
